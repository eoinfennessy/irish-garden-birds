A recent colonist, it arrived in Ireland in 1959, after a rapid expansion through Europe in the preceding decades. It is now a widespread bird in Ireland but it shows a marked preference for suburbs, small towns and cereal growing areas. In the wider countryside it is only found in lowland areas and often in the vicinity of farm buildings, tends to avoid open countryside. Breeds in the dense foliage of trees. Nest a small flimsy flat platform of fine twigs. Usually two eggs.
